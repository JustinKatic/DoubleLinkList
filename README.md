# DoubleLinkList

# DESCRIPTION
double linked list is a list that allows data to not have to be next to each other inside of memory. It consists of a head node and a tail node these are used to begin our iterations through the list since there is no way to random acess the data due to not being next to each other in ram. each node consists of knowing its next and prev node and that is how we loop through lists. which can be slow when trying to find data. However its pros are it allows us to remove nodes easily due to not having to restucture the list and instead can just change who next and previous are pointing too.
